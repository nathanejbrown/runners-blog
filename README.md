This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# This is a project I'm working on with some other runners that I know to build a page where runners can blog about their experiences, talk about gear, and connect with other runners. The server-side code for it is located at https://github.com/nathanejbrown/running-blog-backend.
